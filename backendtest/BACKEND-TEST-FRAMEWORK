one server on LAN that coordintates the tests
  render devices are the clients:
    browser - webgl 1.0
    nvidia shield - opengles 2.0
    ipad - opengles 2.0
    desktop1 - opengl 3.3
    desktop2 - opengl 4.5
    desktop3 - vulkan

a client constantly polls the network (broadcast a ping in every sec) for new test cases

TODO:
  - central test server
      - constantly running
      - manages clients
      - for every new connected clients passes the tests and receives the result

  - clients that polls and connects to the server
      has a name e.g. android opengl es 2.0 lambdacube backend - 0.3
      implementations:
        - haskell
        - purescript
        - c++

roadmap:
  done - server and clients find each other
  done - send pipeline, client renders and sends back the result, the server saves the image
  done - create test command data structure with DDL
      - pipeline
      - static content
          - images
          - geometry
      - uniform values for each frame (renders multiple frames)
  done - add pipeline schema to DDL
  done - interpret the incoming scene data in test client
  next:
    done - receive the render job results
    construct the test scene in server side
    later - create EDSL for backend tests (configuring data + schema + pipeline)
    done - compare result with the validated image
